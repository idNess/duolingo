# **Duolingo Greek (from English) Vocabulary List**  

## **About**  
Hi! Iâ€™ve completed the last chapter of Duolingo Greek (from English) and felt that the app was missing a well-organized vocabulary list by subject. To address this, I extracted and categorized the words from the "Words" section using a small Python script on the Duolingo HTML page.  

This list is designed to help learners practice vocabulary in a structured way, making it easier to study specific topics.  

## **How to Use This List**  
You can use this vocabulary list to create **flashcards** in AnkiAPP by following these steps:  

1. Download the CSV file.
