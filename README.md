# Duolingo Greek (from English) Vocabulary List
Hi! I reached the last chapter of Duolingo Greek from English, and I felt the app was missing a proper vocabulary list divided by subject. I extracted and categorized the words in the "Words" section (a small python script on the Duolingo HTML page).

You can easily make flashcards with AnkiAPP by downloading the CSV file and then following these steps: https://www.ankiapp.com/support/solutions/d9195d06/can-i-import-decks-from-spreadsheets-csv-/ 
You can use the third column as "Tag" column in order to practice only for the subjects you want.

The categories are the following (some follow the Duolingo Chapter, some don't):
